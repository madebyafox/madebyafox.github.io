abstract={In cognitive science, diagrams are often treated as tools for thinking. They may be both reflective of, and active in, our cognitive activities. Unfortunately, our tools for analyzing diagram construction are limited and often difficult to scale. In this brief I will introduce a potential line of research utilizing digital pen systems to explore the production of diagrams. I will discuss the affordances of digital pen technologies and how these might be utilized in diagram research. Finally, I will discuss potential research questions and directions for future work.},

title={Overcoming Graphical Fixedness: Scaffolding Comprehension for Unconventional Graphs}, 
html={https://diagrams-conference.org/2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Diagrams2018GSProceedings.pdf}, 
abstract={How do we make sense of a graph we’ve never seen before? Kosslyn [1] suggests we instantiate a hierarchically-organized graph schema. But what schema is triggered for novel representations? Pinker [2] speculates readers in- stantiate a “general graph schema” likely based on the coordinate system and “predominate graphical forms”. But what information does this schema contain, and how does it interact with prior knowledge of other graphical forms? Here we investigate the graph schema by exploring how learners read an unconventional representation. We ask: (1) What strategies do learners employ to make sense of an unconventional graph? (2) What explicit information might scaffold (self-di- rected) comprehension? (3) Can structuring graph-reading tasks as insight prob- lems help overcome contradictory prior knowledge? (4) What is the time-course and of mental model formation? (5) What inscriptions serve as the graphical framework, triggering a particular graph schema?},

title={Stepping Closer To A Science of Interaction: A Paradigm for Studying the Cognitive Mechanisms of Interaction}, 
booktitle = {Doctoral Symposium of IEEE VIS},
html={https://ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/doctoral-colloquium}, 
abstract={Interaction is crucial for effective visualization. Yet, most of our research centers on representations of information, and the extent to which they support human operators performing well-specified tasks. Despite impressive progress developing tools for interaction, our understanding of how to employ these techniques is based largely on intuition and ad-hoc evaluation from disparate research communities. What happens—in the mind and body—when a user “interacts” with a visualization? In this dissertation I aim to develop a paradigm for studying interaction with representations in the same principled way we have treated visual encodings. Such a paradigm necessarily involves multiple levels of analysis, and seeks to bridge a functional gap between the study of cognition and the study visualization. Only once we understand how and why different interaction techniques are effective can we offer predictive guidelines for the design of human-information systems},
