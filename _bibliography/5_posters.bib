abstract={The present investigation addresses the use of static vs. dynamic visualizations for
learning declarative and procedural information under the topic domain of computer
networking. One hundred and ten undergraduates were exposed to both procedural and
declarative instructional material either in the form of static visualizations or dynamic
visualizations. Participants were tested twice on both declarative and procedural
information, once before exposure to the instructional material to measure baseline
knowledge and once after exposure to measure information gain. The format of each test
matched the nature of the information presented. The declarative test took the form of
open-ended questions; the procedural test was a performance test. The results of this
study indicated effects of visualization type for learning a procedure. Results are 
discussed in terms of multimedia learning, and applied to the design of multimedia
materials},

title={Constructing knowledge from interactive visualizations: How conceptual understanding influences representational choice‬}, url={http://tinyurl.com/hlowngg}, 
abstract={Users often prefer representations containing task-irrelevant information (Smallman & Cook, 2011) even when they are experts (Hegarty, Smallman, Stull, & Canham, 2009). Representational choice, a component of meta-representational competence (diSessa, 2004), may also be influenced by conceptual understanding of what the display represents. Canham and Hegarty (2010) stated that an individual’s conceptual understanding should enhance their focus on task-relevant information. We argue that conceptual understanding enhances a focus on task-relevant information and accordingly requires less deselection of task-irrelevant information. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of an individual’s conceptual understanding on representational choice.
Two factors, Essay Task (content, surface) and Initial Display (overview, blank) were crossed yielding a 2 x 2 between-subjects design with two dependent variables: Representational choice and Performance. Participants viewed an Interactive Data Visualization (IDV) depicting indicators of human development and completed an essay task by conceptually interpreting the data (content) or by only describing the display’s functions (surface). To use the IDV, users had to either (1) deselect task-irrelevant information from an overview initial-display or (2) to select task-relevant information from a blank initial-display. Representational choice was measured as the amount of task-irrelevant data chosen to answer graph-reading questions. Performance was measured as time spent on correctly answered graph-reading questions.
Ninety-five undergraduates participated in the study. Participants began by developing domain knowledge by reading a passage about historical events and were assigned to one of two essay tasks (content, surface). Finally, they completed 12 graph-reading questions consisting of multiple-choice questions, using the initial-display of their experimental condition.
We hypothesized that participants assigned to the content essay task, by building conceptual understanding, would deselect less task-irrelevant information from the overview initial-display, but perform as well as users in the surface essay task.
Representational choice. Results indicated a significant main effect for Essay Task, F(1, 91) = 5.888, η² = .06, p = .017, however, this finding is qualified by the significant interaction with Initial Display, F(1, 91) = 5.027, η² = .05, p =.025. In the blank condition, both task groups showed low task-irrelevant data. In the overview condition, the content group chose representations with more task-irrelevant data as compared to the surface group, d(94) = .67, p < .01.
Performance. Results indicated a significant interaction between Essay Task and Initial Display, F(1, 91) = 5.723, η² =.06, p = .019. The fastest performance was accomplished by the surface group in the blank condition. In the overview condition, the content group, even in the presence of more irrelevant information, attained the same performance as the surface group.
The representational choice of the content group in the overview condition contained the more irrelevant data. However, their task performance did not suffer in terms of the speed for correct answers. Therefore, they seemed to be able to focus attention on the task-relevant data in the presence of irrelevant noise. In sum, our results can be explained by Canham and Hegarty’s (2010) finding about the effect of conceptual understanding on attention allocation.},

abstract = {The present investigation aimed to determine whether implicit and explicit attitudes toward homosexuals can be influenced by the information contained in an infographic, moderated by peoples’ Need for Cognition (NFC). We were also interested in the degree to which learning from the infographic, and participants’ perceived personal involvement with homosexuality, were related to attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Three infographics were designed that displayed different amounts of information about homosexuality (high vs. low vs. none). Results revealed that an infographic with a high amount of information influences implicit attitudes only toward lesbians in a positive way, moderated by people’s NFC. For the explicit attitude measures, we found a main effect for NFC. Perceived personal involvement was the only predictor of attitudes toward homosexuals under certain conditions. Especially the attitudes of people high in NFC toward homosexuals can be influenced by an infographic; the high information infographic is most effective. Since involvement might play a role in attitude change, the relationship between involvement, attitude, and NFC requires further investigation.},

abstract={Previous work on scaffolding graph comprehension has focused on connecting the features of a graph to its domain content (Mautone & Mayer, 2007). But what happens when we encouter a
graph that is completely unfamiliar? The two graphs below represent the same information about a schedule of events. They are informationally equivalent: all data (start, end and duration) that
can be read from one graph can be read from the other. But the graph on the left uses an unconventional coordinate system where a single point has two intersections with the x-axis —neither of
which are orthogonal, as we expect in a Cartesian coordinate system. The Triangular Model of Interval Relations was introduced by a team of GIS researchers (Qiang, Vaicke, De Maeuer, Van de
Weghe, 2014) looking for a more efficient way to represent large data sets of intervals. It is an alternative to the conventional representation for intervals in this domain —the linear model.},

find that although this new visualization technique may yield a small
improvement in causal inference, it also yields a detrimental effect on
confidence and accuracy of correlation judgements. Our results suggest that improving reasoning with data visualizations requires more

 abstract={Data visualizations facilitate knowledge construction about data, both in the classroom and research practice.  But we lack similarly powerful tools for representing the conceptual structure of the studies that generate these data. In this poster I present my adaptation of a diagrammatic notation first developed for software systems [IDEF0].  Through examples, I demonstrate how this new diagram makes explicit an empirical study’s: central theoretical construct,  variables that are systematically varied, structurally or statistically controlled, left uncontrolled, or measured, and how each variable is operationalized. I further demonstrate how the diagram can be used as an instructional aid or formative assessment in methods and content courses when teaching students how to read and interpret experimental research.},
