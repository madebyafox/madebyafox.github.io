catalog_description: >
  This course examines memory, reasoning, language, culture, planning, and interaction directly in everyday, real-world settings. Focuses on ethnographic methods, their history, and their application. The course work includes projects in which students make observations of real-world activity and analyze their cognitive significance. Prerequisites: COGS 102A.

While rigorously controlled laboratory experiments are a gold standard for hypothesis testing in the behavioural sciences — there is an extraordinarily rich tapestry of human behaviour only observable outside the laboratory ... in the wild.  In COGS 102B you'll develop your methodological toolkit for qualitative research appropriate for studying applied cognition, HCI and design & interaction.
