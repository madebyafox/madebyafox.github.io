<b> I study Human-Information Interaction. </b> At the intersection of cognitive, information, and learning sciences, I explore how humans create and appropriate tools for thinking. These cognitive technologies range from stunning interactive visualizations of data, simple charts and graphs, diagrams, systems of notation, to even the text on this screen.

<b>I leverage what we know about human cognition to inform the design of tools for thinking, and study their everyday use to learn about human cognition.</b>



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
