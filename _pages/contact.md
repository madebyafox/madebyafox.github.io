description: The best way to get in contact with me is via email at amyraefox at ucsd dot edu. If I do not respond to your email in a timely manner, please don't hesitate to send a follow-up note! Email is the bane of my existence and one of my greatest professional weaknesses. Apologies in advance :)

<h1>OFFICE HOURS</h1>
All UCSD students (even if you're not currently enrolled in one of my classes!) are welcome to visit me in office hours.  For Winter 2026 you can find me on: Wednesdays 11:00-12:00PM (CSB 255) and Thursdays 11:00-12:00PM (ZOOM). For access to my ZOOM office hours, please see your course syllabus, or contact me via email.  

<h1>GRADUATE ADVISING</h1>
<i>I am not currently recruiting graduate students for the 2026-2027 Academic Year (current year applicants). </i> 
However, I am available for co-advising, to serve on PHD dissertation committees, Masters thesis committees, advise PhD lab rotations, and independent study quarters. <b>If your topic of interest involves information visualization, diagrams, illustrations, or graphical communication more broadly, please reach out via email to see if I may be a good fit for your advising needs. I am particularly keen to work with students taking multidisciplinary approaches, and welcome non-CogSci students to get in touch.</b>  

<h1>UNDERGRADUATE THESIS ADVISING</h1>
Each year I am available to supervise a limited number of undergraduate honors theses. If you are applying for the honors thesis program and would like to discuss my serving as your advisor, please reach out via email with a brief description of your interests and potential project. I am an enthusiastic supporter of undergraduate research opportunities! 

<h1>FUNDED RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES</h1>
I am not currently recruiting for funded research positions; but will update this page when such opportunities become available. 

<h1>JOINING THE GRAPHICAL COGNITION GROUP</h1>
I'll be launching my research lab (tentatively named the Graphical Cognition & Communication Group) in Fall 2027! Check back in early 2027 for more information about joining the lab as a grad student, undergraduate researcher or visiting researcher. 

<h1>TEACHING ASSISTANTS</h1>
The hiring process for (graduate) TAs is managed by the Cognitive Science Department, and <a href="https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/graduates/teaching-assistants/index.html"> applications</a> are typically open partway through the previous academic quarter. Note that priority is typically given to Cognitive Science PhD students, though applicants from other departments may be considered if there is a particular match between your skillset and the course requirements.  <b>Please do not email me with your CV/resume, as I am not able to work outside the official hiring process. </b>

<h1>UNDERGRADUATE PLAs</h1>
If you are an undergraduate student interested in joining the teaching team for one of my courses and gaining course credit for working as a PLA (Pedagogical Learning Apprentice), please reach out to me via email <i> in the quarter preceeding the quarter in which you are interested in teaching. </i> 

<h1>RECOMMENDATION LETTERS</h1>
If I have had the pleasure of working with you as a TA, PLA, or research advisee, I would be happy to provide a letter of recommendation. If you have not worked with me in these capacities but have taken one my classes, I am likely not the best person to provide with you with a recommendation letter that speaks to your unique skills and capabilities.  To request a recommendation, please visit me in office hours, or reach out via email with "LOR" in the subject line.
