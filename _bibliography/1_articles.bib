	abstract = {How does one visually represent the use of time? We explored students’ use of graphical metaphors by asking undergraduates at a public French university to generate representations of their personal time-use including: activities, sequence, duration, timing, and frequency. The resulting use of space and form was analyzed by way of an iteratively developed coding scheme. We discuss how the analyses of the spontaneous productions support previous research on spatial representations of time, and the implications for the design of time management tools for students.},

	abstract = {How do you make sense of a graph that you have never seen before? In this work, we outline the types of prior knowledge relevant when making sense of an unconventional statistical graph. After observing students reading a deceptively simple graph for time intervals, we designed four instructional scaffolds for evaluation. In a laboratory study, we found that only one scaffold (an interactive image) supported accurate interpretation for most students. Subsequent analysis of differences between two sets of materials revealed that task structure–specifically the extent to which a problem poses a mental impasse–may function as a powerful aid for comprehension. We find that prior knowledge of conventional graph types is extraordinarily difficult to overcome.},
