catalog_description: >
  This course examines the interrelationships of cognition and technology from the perspective of cognitive science. We address questions of importance for our increasingly technological society: How does technology shape our minds? How should what we know about our minds shape technology?

---

  How should we make informed decisions about how to engage with modern technologies? In this course we connect some of the most foundational ideas in cognitive science and design (the power of representation) to modern technology choices. In doing so, you'll expand your notion of what cognition and technology actually are, and develop a conceptual toolkit for making better technology choices in your daily life.
