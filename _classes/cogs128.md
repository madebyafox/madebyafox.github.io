  This course frames information visualization as a quintessential cognitive science problem within our interdisciplinary field. Students learn conceptual and practical aspects of creating high-quality, interactive information displays to support a variety of cognitive tasks and then apply them to real-world data.

The ability to analyze and present data via visuospatial means has become one of the most important skills for students who want to work in design, HCI, data science and related fields. More importantly, the ability to accurately interpret and evaluate information presented visually is crucial to acting as an informed member of civil society.  In this  course you will learn how to critically examine and design effective static and interactive representations of information, and get hands-on experience creating visualizations for exploration and storytelling.
