	abstract = {Graph comprehension is the act of deriving meaning from graphs, an activity grounded in visuospatial reasoning that develops through a combination of instruction and practice. What we know about the mechanisms of graph comprehension stems from interleaving lines of inquiry in statistics, computer science, education, and psychology dating back to the 1980s. In this integrative review, I describe how models of graph comprehension evolved in response to developments in cognitive theory, offering a critical commentary on how foundational theories build upon each other, extending rather than replacing theoretical claims at different levels of analysis. I illuminate the landscape of contemporary research, before concluding with an argument for the role of visualization psychology in supporting theoretical integration across disciplinary boundaries.},

	abstract = {What might a discipline of Visualization Psychology look like? If research on the psychological aspects of visualization were to coalesce, in the sense of a Lakatosian research program, what refutation-resistant theoretical commitments would magnetize its “hard core”? In this chapter, we argue that any interdisciplinary inquiry concerned with psychological aspects of visualization should situate its phenomena in the broader context of external representation, as a (triadic) semiotic activity achieved via information processing in a distributed cognitive system.},
