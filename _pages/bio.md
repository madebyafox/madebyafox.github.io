Dr. Amy Rae Fox is a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of Cognitive Science at UC San Diego, whose research centers on the role of cognition in information visualization and diagrammatic reasoning. 

Prior to joining the faculty at UCSD, she worked as a Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow at MIT with the Visualization Group, where she lead projects exploring the influence of sociocultural phenomena on data visualization, and the role of interactive visualizations in exploratory data analysis. She completed her doctoral research at UC San Diego, examining the integration of perceptual and knowledge-driven processing in graphical discovery—an often-neglected stage of graph comprehension that characterizes how humans construct meaning for unfamiliar graphs. Dr. Fox holds an MSEd in Instructional Design from Universite Grenoble, an MA in Interdisciplinary Studies (Cognitive Visualization) from California State Chico, and BSc in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she was a Morehead Scholar. Prior to graduate school, she worked as a management and technology consultant for nearly a decade, honing her skills in project management, information architecture and design.  

Dr. Fox is a leader in the burgeoning interdisciplinary research community of <i> Visualization Psychology </i>, contributing to the IEEE VIS, Cognitive Science, Psychonomics, GRC VSE and Diagrams research communitites.  She is a proud first generation college student, and enthusiastic mentor of students taking non-traditional paths through industry and academia. 


<!-- MIT BIO::  Dr. Amy Fox is a METEOR and School of Engineering Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow whose research centers on the role of cognition in information visualization and diagrammatic reasoning. At MIT, Amy is investigating interactive visualization to address a central challenge in visualization research and design: the common belief that extracting insights from visual data is easy when, in fact, we rely on years of explicit training and implicit exposure. Amy’s doctoral research examined the integration of perceptual and knowledge-driven processing in graphical discovery—an often-neglected stage of graph comprehension that characterizes how humans construct meaning for unfamiliar graphs. The goal of her postdoctoral work is to lay the groundwork for a generalized theory of interaction through mixed-method research. This theory will support her future efforts to leverage what we know about human cognition when building information systems and artifacts and, conversely, to study their everyday use to advance theories of human cognition. As visualization becomes a central medium for communication and decision-making, Amy’s work has the potential for significant social impact, from scientific research and data analysis to personal decisions about our health and well-being. -->
