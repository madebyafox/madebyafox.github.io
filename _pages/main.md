<b> Welcome! </b> As a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Teaching in the <a href="https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/" target=_blank>Department of Cognitive Science</a> at UC San Diego, I teach and conduct research on topics at the intersection of cognition and computing. 

<b> I study the cognitive science of graphical representation. </b> At the intersection of cognitive, information, and learning sciences, I explore how humans create, understand and make use of graphical representations as <i>tools for thinking</i>. These cognitive technologies range from stunning interactive visualizations of data, to simple charts graphs, diagrams and systems of notation.

<b>I leverage what we know about human cognition to inform the design of these tools for thinking, and study their everyday use to advance our understanding of human cognition.</b>
