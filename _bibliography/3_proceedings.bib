	abstract = {Can the representation of event sequence influence how jurors remember and reason in a legal case? We addressed this ques-tion by examining the interaction between an individual's pre-ferred spatial construal of time (SCT) for an external (visual-spatial) representation and the SCT of a courtroom graphic. One hundred fifty three undergraduates played the role of ju-rors in a fictitious civil trial. The details of a case were re-counted in a multimedia presentation featuring timelines an-imated in one of four orientations: left-right, right-left, top-bottom, and bottom-top. Participants were assessed on mea-sures of comprehension and causal reasoning. Results indi-cated effects of timeline orientation and SCT choice behav-ior on comprehension and reasoning. We discuss these results in terms of the role of attention in temporal-causal reasoning, and implications for the design of multimedia materials for the courtroom.},

title={Graphical Insight: How to Read an Unconventional Graph}, 
abstract={How do you make sense of a graph that you have never seen before? Building on recent work demonstrating that prior knowledge of conventional graph types is extraordinarily difficult to overcome, we explore the use of implicit scaffolding to reconstruct graph reading as an insight problem. We hypothesize that constructing a mental impasse will improve learner performance by increasing the probability learners will reconsider their default interpretation strategies and recognize alternative interpretations of novel graphical forms. In a between-subjects laboratory experiment we find support for this hypothesis. Analysis of qualitative data suggests promising directions for understanding graphical intuitions, and we conclude with suggestions for future work that address the timing of mental model formation for unconventional graphic forms.},

	abstract = {How do you make sense of an unconventional graph? Building on research demonstrating that prior knowledge of graphical conventions is difficult to overcome, we reconstrue graph reading as an insight problem. We hypothesize that imposing a mental impasse during a particular type of graph reading task will improve comprehension by inducing a sense of puzzlement, prompting learners to reconsider their interpretation. We find support for this proposal in a betweensubjects experiment in which participants presented with an impasse-formulated version of graph reading questions are significantly more likely to correctly interpret a graph featuring an unconventional coordinate system. We characterize the differential patterns of mouse movements for learners between conditions and discuss implications for the use of novel graphical forms in science communication.},

	abstract={The Burden of Selfhood is an interdisciplinary performance artwork exploring the intersection of feminism, identity and technology. By connecting methods from cognitive science, music, poetry, video and performance art, we investigate the experience of viewing and being viewed as a gendered body. Technology has accelerated the recursive gaze to the point that we continually perform and project back onto each other our internalized expectations for unattainable perfection. This poly-vocal performance uses large-scale data visualizations and live performers to make explicit both the collective gaze and the implicit impact of being seen.

	abstract = {The historical moment when a person worked in front of a single computer has passed. Computers are now ubiquitous and embedded in virtually every new device and system, connecting our personal and professional activities to ever-expanding information resources with previously unimaginable computational power. Yet with all the increases in capacity, speed, and connectivity, our experiences too often remain difficult, awkward, and frustrating. Even after six decades of design evolution there is little of the naturalness and contextual sensitivity required for convivial interaction with computer-mediated information. We envision a future in which the existing world of documents and applications is linked to a multiscale personalized information space in which dynamic visual entities behave in accordance with cognitively motivated rules sensitive to tasks, personal and group interaction histories, and context. The heart of the project is to rethink the nature of computer-mediated information as a basis to begin to fully realize the potential of computers to assist information-based activities. This requires challenging fundamental presuppositions that have led to today’s walled gardens and information silos. Our goal is to catalyze an international research community to rethink the nature of information as a basis for radically advancing the human-centered design of information-based work and helping to ensure the future is one of convivial, effective, and humane systems. In this paper, we propose a new view of information systems, discuss cognitive requirements for a human-centered information space, and sketch a research agenda and approach.},

	abstract = {What is a visualization? There is limited utility in trifling with definitions, except insofar as one serves as a tool for communicating and conceptualizing our subject matter; a statement of identity for a community. To establish Visualization Psychology as a viable inter-disciplinary research programme, we must first define the object(s) of our collective inquiry. I propose that while we might refer to the study of "visualization" for the term's colloquial accessibility and pragmatic alignment with other fields, we should consider for exploration a class of artifacts and corresponding processes more expansive and profound: external representations. What follows is an argument for the study of external representation as the foundation for a new interdisciplinary endeavor, and approach to mapping the corresponding problem space.},

	abstract = {Students of visualization come to formal education with an abundance of personal experience. However, one's exposure to graphics through media and education may not be sufficiently diverse to appreciate the nuance and complexity required to design and evaluate effective representations. While many introductory courses in visualization address best practices for visual encoding of data based on perceptual characteristics, as cognitive scientists, we place equal value on representational decisions based on communicative context: how the representation is intended to be used. In this pedagogical activity, we aim to surface learners' preconceived notions about what makes a visualization effective. Here we describe the structure and context of an introductory-level visualization activity, how it might be conducted in individual or group settings, our experience with the common misconceptions the activity can reveal, and conclude with recommendations on how they might be addressed.},
